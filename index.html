			<p>As the 2018 Asian Games came to an end earlier this month, India's sporting world added 69 medals to its trophy closet. A contingent of 572 athletes athletes participated in nearly 40 events in Jakarta, Indonesia, and ranked 8th overall.</p>
			<p>Since New Delhi hosted the inaugural Games in 1951, India has been one of a handful of nations that have taken part in each edition and has ranked within the top 10 countries almost every year. According to the data, India can credit its star athletes, female athletics participants and a burgeoning sports development scene amongst other factors for its improving performance in the last decade (even if we’re still catching up to the big players, like China.)</p>
			<p>"We've just started our journey professionally," says Olympian shooter and former World No. 1 Anjali Bhagwat. "Performance-wise and medal colour-wise, this is the biggest achievement we've had so far."</p>
			<p>And she's right; this year India won its highest number of medals ever. Here’s a breakdown of what that means for India’s performance overall at the Asian Games.</p>

			<h3>Start with India's medal tally</h3>
			<p>Let us look at every single medal awarded to Indian Asian Games athletes and teams in just the last four decades, since India hosted the Games for the second time in 1982. There are 454 in total: <span class="chart1-span span1-gold">91 gold</span> medals, <span class="chart1-span span1-silver">128 silver</span> and <span class="chart1-span span1-bronze">235 bronze</span>.</p>

			<p>India won 57 medals in the 1982 Games; significantly higher than India’s performance in previous editions of the Games as well as the editions immediately after. In fact, adding up the medal tallies on the Olympic Council of Asia website reveals that the number of medals a host country wins is almost always higher than the number it wins at the previous and the following editions.</p>
			<p>"When you’re the host, you get a lot of encouragement from the government, and you'll automatically get a larger contingent because you want to perform in front of your country," he says. "They must have been training for five to eight years before this Asian Games, and so just the repetition, repetition, repetition gave them the skills to win more medals."</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.asiangames2018.id/news/articles/indonesia-contingent-inaugurated-ready-to-make-its-mark-at-asiad/" target="_blank">Their contingent also had 938 athletes</a> this year compared with just 188 athletes in the 2014 Games in Incheon, South Korea. But Bhagwat explains that host countries don’t always have the home advantage.</p>
			<p>"It may hamper you because you're participating in front of your own country; you have more pressure, more people are watching you," she says. "But I think if you are hosting a big event, you have sufficient time in hand to start preparing for the competition."</p>
			<p>Here are all of India’s post-1982 medals again, distributed across the last four decades.</p>

			<p>India’s medal achievement picked up in the mid-2000s and has stayed high since. This year, we achieved the highest number of Asian Games medals India has won, including the highest number of gold and silver medals.</p>
			<p>In the long-term, there has been a gradual change towards families accepting sports and encouraging their children to pursue them at a professional and competitive level. Dr. Paes says the rise of professional groups within the last decade or so, such as the I-League and the Indian Premier League, have contributed to its image as a viable career option.</p>
			<p>"Players started making more money; earning 40 lakhs, one crore," he says. "Suddenly, parents see a future in sports by way of monetary benefits, jobs, fame and fortune."</p>
			<p>Athletes can now also get support from organizations such as <a href="https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/index.php" target="_blank">Olympic Gold Quest</a> and <a href="https://www.gosportsfoundation.in/" target="_blank">GoSports</a>, that provide training facilities, resources and scholarships.</p>
			<p>Part of the sudden increase in medals in 2006 can be also attributed to India’s shooting team. Though the sport is now India's second best Asian Games sport in terms of medal achievement, between 1982 and 2002 we usually only won between one and three medals. But in 2006, the shooting team included Vijay Kumar, Gagan Narang, Jaspal Rana and Manavjit Singh Sandhu, who collectively won nine out of our 14 medals that year. These four athletes are also among a handful who have won five or more medals at the Asian Games.</p>

			<h3>High achievers</h3>
			<p>In fact, just 11 athletes are responsible for 71 of India's 454 medals won since 1982 – that's 15 percent. Since 1982, the athletes below have won between three and seven medals each year either as individuals or on a team, but 2006 and 2010 were exceptions as India’s shooting and tennis teams performed extremely well.</p>
			<p>Apart from India’s successful shooting lineup in 2006, tennis stars Sania Mirza and Leander Paes also won three of our four tennis medals. Similarly, in 2010, Vijay Kumar, Gagan Narang and Manavjit Singh Sandhu won five of India’s eight shooting medals, while Sania Mirza and Saurav Ghosal both won two medals each in tennis and squash respectively.</p>

			<h3>Female athletes hold their own</h3>
			<p>Over the years, more sporting events for women have been introduced – such as women's wrestling in 2002 – allowing more female athletes to compete. This year, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/india-announces-524-athletes-for-asian-games/story-tERNvhw7SlzwXR5GspyPeJ.html" target="_blank">nearly half of the Indian competitors</a> (247 athletes i.e. 43 percent) were women.</p>
			<p>As a result, the number of medals won by <span class="chart3-span span3-women">female athletes and teams</span> has also generally increased, compared with the number won by <span class="chart3-span span3-men">male participants,</span> and <span class="chart3-span span3-mixed">mixed gender teams.</span></p>

			<p>In particular, women have played a significant role in India’s athletics medal achievement. Athletics is one of India’s biggest strengths in the Asian Games; 124 of our total 454 medals (27 percent) come from this sport alone. This is partly because athletics has the largest number of contested disciplines – this year there were 48 races and events <span class="chart3-span span7-women">women</span>, <span class="chart3-span span7-men">men</span> and <span class="chart3-span span7-mixed">mixed</span> teams.</p>
			<p>However, India's prowess in these sports should not be discounted. Our athletes have won more than five medals since 1982 in each of the events listed below. Female athletes have won equal or more medals than their male counterparts in all but two disciplines, and have won 78 of our 124 (63 percent) medals so far.</p>

			<h3>A long way to go</h3>
			<p>India ranked eighth in the 2018 Asian Games medal tally, but in terms of the total medals won since the Games began in 1951, India ranks fourth behind China, Japan and South Korea. While fourth place is not too bad, there is a large gulf between India’s 665 medals overall and South Korea, which ranks third with 2,233 medals in total.</p>

			<h3>Why is India so far behind?</h3>
			<p>One of the possible reasons could be the types of sports India has excelled in. Since 1982, Indian athletes have performed well in conventional sports such as athletics (more than 100 medals), shooting, boxing and tennis (more than 25 medals each) in the Asian Games alone. These four sports, along with several others, have also been contested in the Asian Games since the 1950s, thus giving India more opportunities to win medals in those rather than newly-introduced sports like wushu and kurash.</p>
			<p>"We are quick-thinking and intelligent so technically we are strong, but physically we are weaker, so we need to take advantage of sports that require high reflexes and low body contact," explains Dr. Paes. "It is stated that China and India will never do well in soccer because our culture does not allow us to touch one another – we take offense. If we’re not used to body contact, how will we be good at football? We need to play sports that have low body contact like badminton, table tennis, squash, golf, chess – these are the sports we do very well in because there is no pressure of body contact."</p>
			<p>Given that kabaddi is a traditional South Asian sport, it seemed only natural that India had won every single gold medal since men's kabaddi was introduced to the Asian Games in 1990 and women's in 2010 ... until Iran's men's and women's teams clinched them both this year. The women’s team held onto the silver medal, but the men’s team tied with Pakistan for the bronze while the silver medal went to South Korea.</p>
			<p>As a nation of cricket fanatics, would we have done better if the sport were included? We haven't had the opportunity to find out yet. Cricket was played at the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games, but the <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/766247.html" target="_blank">BCCI chose not to send a men's or women's team</a> to compete leaving Pakistan to win the gold medal both years.</p>
			<p>"I think at that time, we had our schedule already done and we could not send our first team," says Niranjan Shah, former BCCI official and current chairman of the National Cricket Academy. "Our whole program was already made five to six years in advance."</p>
			<p>"It is very important that we play tournaments with major cricket-playing countries, because the main revenue is from those tours," Shah continues. India's men's cricket team was in Sri Lanka during the 2010 Games, and was touring England during the 2014 Games. Shah says he does not know why the second men’s team or the women’s teams did not participate.</p>
			<p>So what will it take for India to reach the top of the medal tally?</p>
			<p>"If we want to go further, we have to sustain the financial system that's supporting Indian sports," says Dr. Paes. "Our aims should be higher – though we came fourth [in the overall medal tally], our target should be to take on the top three countries, China, Japan and South Korea."</p>
			<p>"Once we’ve reached that level, we can say that we have arrived."</p>
